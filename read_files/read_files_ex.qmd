The function reads all the files in the folder "data" and then creates a big
data frame. 

The file names should have the same lenght. 

This function uses characters from the file name to create columns. For ex, 
in this case uses the first character to create a condition column and the next
2 characters to create a participant column. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(rlang)

source("read_files.R")

dat <- read_files("data/", cond = 1, participant = 2)

dat
```
